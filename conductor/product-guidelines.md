# Product Guidelines

## Design & Branding Principles

### Prose Style
- Use clear, concise language with a friendly tone
- Prioritize user-centric phrasing (e.g., "Our users will love..." instead of "The system will...")
- Maintain consistent terminology across all documentation

### Brand Messaging
- Core Value Proposition: "Task CLI - Premium task management with React, Ink, and TypeScript"
- Tagline: "Fast. Beautiful. Powerful."
- Key Benefits:
  - Blazing fast CLI with <100ms startup
  - Interactive GUI with real-time updates
  - Priority-based task organization
  - Customizable pink-themed interface

### Visual Identity
- Primary Color: Hot Pink (#FF69B4)
- Secondary Color: Light Pink (#FFB6C1)
- Typography: System default with bold headings
- Iconography: Minimalist line icons for actions
- Spacing: Generous padding for readability

### UI/UX Principles
- Prioritize task visibility and quick access to actions
- Use color to highlight priority levels (red for high, yellow for medium, green for low)
- Maintain consistent layout patterns across all views
- Provide immediate feedback for user actions

## Implementation Notes
- Theme customization should be handled in `src/theme.ts`
- All UI components should follow the Ink framework guidelines
- Ensure accessibility compliance for color contrast and keyboard navigation
