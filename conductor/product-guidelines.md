# Product Guidelines - task-cli

## Voice & Tone
- **Professional & Polished:** Communications should be clear, concise, and helpful. 
- **Subtle Personality:** Use emojis sparingly (e.g., 🚀, ✅, ⚠️) to add visual cues without cluttering the interface.
- **Technical Precision:** Documentation and error messages should be technically accurate and focus on providing immediate utility.

## Visual Identity (TUI)
- **High Contrast & Modern:** The interactive interface should use bold ANSI colors and structured layouts (borders, headers) to clearly differentiate between task lists, metadata, and status bars.
- **Responsive Layout:** The TUI should gracefully handle different terminal sizes, prioritizing core task information.
- **Visual Feedback:** Use distinct colors for priorities (e.g., Red for High, Yellow for Medium) and status (e.g., Strikethrough or Dimmed for completed tasks).

## Brand Messaging
- **AI-Enhanced Productivity:** Position `task-cli` as a critical bridge between a developer's manual workflow and AI-driven automation.
- **Efficiency First:** Emphasize that the tool is designed to save time, both through its snappy performance and its ability to be controlled by AI agents via MCP.

## Documentation Style
- **Structured & Concise:** Focus on command references, parameter definitions, and clear examples of usage.
- **Utility-Driven:** Avoid long prose; use bullet points and code blocks to convey information quickly to technical users.
